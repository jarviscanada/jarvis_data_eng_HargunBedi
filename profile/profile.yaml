summary: "I am a recent Software Engineering graduate from McMaster University, currently working at Jarvis Consulting Group. My academic and professional journey is characterized by my passion for technology and problem-solving, and continuous learning which is evident in my various internships and projects. These experiences have enabled me to gain experience with full-stack web development, QA automation, cloud development, and machine learning.  Among my notable projects, I developed a scalable e-commerce website using a microservices architecture with technologies like Node/Express.js and AWS. Motivated by the practical experience I encountered through this project, I am also currently pursuing the AWS Associate Developer Certification to further deepen my understanding and in cloud-based solutions and technologies. In terms of my professional experience, during my internship as an Application Programmer, I significantly contributed to automated testing processes and played a vital role in ensuring efficient project delivery and my role at Develop For Good involved implementing revamped webpages for a non-profit website using React.js and MUI. These experiences reflect my adaptability, dedication, and desire to learn in contributing effectively to diverse software development environments."
