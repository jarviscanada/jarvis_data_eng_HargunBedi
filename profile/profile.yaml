summary: "I am a recent Software Engineering graduate from McMaster University. Currently, I am working for Jarvis Consulting Group. Prior to joining Jarvis, I have completed a few internships and projects that have helped me to gain experience with full-stack web development, qa automation, cloud development and machine learning. I chose software engineering because it combines my interests in problem-solving, technology, and continuous learning. I have always loved seeing how complex problems are often broken down into smaller ones and then solved in a very structured and reasoned way. It is one of the few fields where you constantly need to improve yourself and keep learning, presenting an unique challenge."
